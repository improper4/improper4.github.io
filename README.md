<h1>This is the data for my blog</h1>
<hr>
<p>It is automatically transformed by Jekyll into a static site whenever <br/>I push this repository to GitHub.</p>
<p>I was tired of having my blog posts end up in a database off on some <br/>remote server. That is backwards. Iâ€™ve lost valuable posts that way. I <br/>
want to author my posts locally in Textile or Markdown. My blog should <br/>
be easily stylable and customizable any way I please. It should take care<br/> of creating a feed for me. And most of all, my site should be stored on <br/>GitHub so that I never lose data again.</p>
